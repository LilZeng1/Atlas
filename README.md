## Overview

**ATLAS** is a structured Discord community built around disciplined discussion.

It is **not** a religion-only server.  
Debate is central — but topics vary:

- Philosophy  
- Ethics (religious & philosophical)  
- Theology  
- Gaming  
- Anime  
- Books  
- Culture  
- Open discourse  

The environment is chill, but the standards are strict.

## ___Core Principles___

### **Respect is Fundamental**
Critique ideas — not people.  
No insults. No hate. No personal attacks.

### **Freedom of Expression ≠ Abuse**
Rational discussion is welcome.  
Provocation, hostility, or incitement is not.

### **Structured Moderation**
Clear penalty system.  
Decisions are enforced.  
Severe violations = immediate permanent ban.
